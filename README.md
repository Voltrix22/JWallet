# JWallet
Simple wallet with Java and SQL

This is the start of my tiny project, which will be in two languages - Polish and English.
For now there is only Polish language to test this app. In the future will be also English.

First upload of project. You can see only basic salary functions like creating new account, add salary, edit password in account, delete account.
In the future I plan to include withdraws, adding bills with list of what you bought and more.
